# Battleships Game

## How to play the game
### In my version of Battleships:
- The user will first be asked for their name.
- Two 5x5 game boards will then be randomly generated with 4 battleships on each.
- The user can only see the battleships on their own board.
- The user is prompted for a row and a column which they can input their next guess.
- After each guess the user is told the outcome whether thats a Hit marked by a '*' or a miss marked by 'X'. 
- The goal is the hit all of the computers battleships before they hit all of yours.

## Features
